            <strong>The United States is experiencing a housing crisis like no other time in its history. </strong>
            <p>Housing insecurity has affected people of all backgrounds, including families, students, people
                with advanced degrees, people with mental and physical disabilities, veterans, senior citizens, and
                people
                with job skills no longer in demand. The housing-burdened in the U.S. comprises nearly 37.8 million
                families
                who are spending 30% of their income on housing costs, and almost 18.2 million families who are spending
                50%

            <strong>We Want to Help</strong>
            <p>We were tasked with creating a resource for families looking for affordable housing/purchasing opportunities. As we conducted our research, we learned that families weren't the only populations in need of assistance, and discovered many groups that existed in our own circles. We were compelled to help as many affected as we could.  We also learned that the people often on the frontlines working with individuals and families facing housing insecurity, helping professionals like social workers, teachers, nurses, and higher education professionals, lack a clear, simple resource for assisting with these issues. Our intention was to create an easy-to-use resource for providing housing assistance to those you serve.
